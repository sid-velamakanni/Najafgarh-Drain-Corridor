# Najafgarh-Drain-Corridor

The condition of Delhi’s urban waterways is the result of 150 years of policy and planning that has severed the relationship between the city and its water.

The rehabilitation of Delhi’s waterways requires a holistic approach that considers all of the city’s systems in conjunction.

The Vision proposes to understand the Najafgarh Drain and its tributaries as structural elements of the city –as a geographical urban armature around which the city organizes its systems, including public spaces, public facilities, urban ecologies, and mobility.
